This repository demonstrates a common Java error: ConcurrentModificationException. The example shows a flawed attempt to remove elements from an ArrayList while iterating. The solution provides a safer way to iterate and modify a list concurrently. The `ConcurrentModificationExceptionExample.java` file contains the buggy code, while `ConcurrentModificationExceptionSolution.java` provides a corrected version that avoids the exception.
